- Smart contract files located in the following paths:
    - Rust path: (`rust`) 
    - Solidity path: (`solidity/src`) 
- Rust contracts are under file lib.rs
- Solidity contracts are .sol files
- Always have the Rust contract return an EVM type to the Solidity contract based on EVM types in Rust library alloy.rs
- Rust contract structure define Solidity:
    - Interfaces:
    ```rust
    pub trait RouterAPI
    ```
    - Function implementations:
    ```rust
    impl<SDK: SharedAPI> RouterAPI for ROUTER<SDK> 
    ```
- Rust contracts are compiled to a WASM binary, then deployed to Fluent from the WASM binary
- More info on Fluent and Blended smart contracts can be indexed in these docs `https://docs.fluent.xyz/`
